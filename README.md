# Digital Audio Visualizer
Digital Audio Visualizer (DAV) is a new IEEE project that will pilot in the 2020-2021 academic year. The goal is to teach future members about new topics that existing projects do not cover, such as signal processing, digital logic, FPGAâ€™s, and Verilog. 

To do so, members will design a system that uses an intel FPGA as a digital signals processor. The FPGA will receive audio inputs in real time through an external microphone and display the resulting frequency spectrum on an external display. A block diagram is shown below.
